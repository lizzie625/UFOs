# UFOs  

## Overview  
To build a better webpage, we helped Dana provide a more in-depth analysis to her users. We did this by creating a way to allow users to filter through different criteria at the same time, defining their search results. We added multiple new table filters to the original webpage, including city, state, country, and shape.  
## Results  
We now have 5 separate filters we can use on the webpage to sift through data. In order to do so, all you have to do is type in at least one of the filter boxes, the more filter boxes you use, the more selective the data gets. If you just entered a date, you would have far more result options, than if you entered a date, state, and shape.  
## Summary  
One drawback of this webpage is that the data filters are pretty selective making it harder for people who do not know what they're looking for.  

Two reccomendations I have for futher developement of the webpage would be to make certain categories selectable options, this would eliminate the user wasting time searching for cities or states that there is not any data on. Instead, they would be able to choose from the areas that have data in the database. I would also reccomend havinf search results stay, even after the page is refreshed.
